# Post-Processing toolbox (PPTB) #

This library contains a range of file manipulation and analysis toolkits for CFD-related data.

## Installation

No installation required. Each tool may be built individually as needed with a simple "make" command which will access the necessary header files from the repository.

You will need to specify the environment variable "PPTB" in your bashrc file to have it access the required header files. Something like:

export PPTB=/path_to_PPTB
